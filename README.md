# firstdjango

it is real simple to run this project.
no complicated files are included (css or js ) or anything other dependencies.
all you gotta do is just download the files as it is 
and hit **manage.py runserver** in the project folder 
and its up and running 
I have added an app but the route is host address itself.
was http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in my local machine..
